# ErpUtilities
Utilites are C++ interfaces for any database which is controlled
by AbstractController for Erp Release.

The release in this repo is currently an early alpha just
to demonstrate the use of this library.

The DatabaseSingleton provides multi-threaded database calls
to the database to prevent gui lag.
